This repository contains some quick start scripts.
They can be run on their own or you can use the config files and 
run various pipleine scripts. 

Note: These scripts are not industry grade. They are for small scale studies. 
Large scale infrastructure would need to be in place and other techniques can be used
to get these pipelines adapted for that situation.
